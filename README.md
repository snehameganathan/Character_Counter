## 💡 How It Works

1. The text area allows users to type up to **200 characters**.  
2. As the user types, a live counter updates (e.g., `150 / 200 characters`).  
3. The counter turns **orange** when nearing the limit and **red** once the limit is reached.  
4. A warning message appears if the user reaches the maximum limit.
